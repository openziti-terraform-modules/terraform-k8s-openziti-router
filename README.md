# Terraform Module for Managing an OpenZiti Router in Kubernetes

This module currently uses the Kubernetes Community implementation of Ingress for Nginx, `ingress-nginx`.

## Planned Enhancements

1. Support for other Kubernetes Ingress implementations, e.g., `traefik`
1. Support for a few implementations of Gateway API, e.g., Nginx Gateway

Please feel free to raise an issue if you have a request.
